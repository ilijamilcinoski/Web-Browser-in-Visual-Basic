# Web Browser in Visual Basic




This code is a VB.NET program that defines a simple web browser. It has a few buttons, a text box, and a web browser control. The buttons are used to navigate the web browser control.

The first button navigates to the URL specified in the text box.
The second button goes back to the previous page.
The third button goes forward to the next page.
The fourth button refreshes the current page.
The fifth button goes to the home page.
This code is a basic implementation of a web browser in the Visual Basic programming language. The Form1_Load event handler is used to set the initial text of the form to "Web Browser". The Button1_Click event handler is used to navigate to the URL specified in the TextBox1 control when the user clicks the "Go" button. The Button2_Click event handler is used to go back to the previous page when the user clicks the "Back" button, and the Button3_Click event handler is used to go forward to the next page when the user clicks the "Forward" button. The Button4_Click event handler is used to refresh the current page when the user clicks the "Refresh" button, and the Button5_Click event handler is used to go to the user's home page when the user clicks the "Home" button.
